| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Yandex 360 | Yandex's workspace suite (mail, calendar, disk, Telemost, etc.). The product whose private API this CLI targets. |
| Public API | Yandex 360's documented/official API. Narrower than first-party clients — the gap this project closes. |
| Private endpoint | An internal endpoint used by the Yandex 360 web/mobile apps but not exposed in the public API. The reverse-engineering target. |
| Telemost | Yandex's video-conferencing product inside Yandex 360. One of the surfaces to reach. |
| Session token | The auth token captured from a real logged-in Yandex 360 session, used in place of public API keys. |
| Token interception | `yx360 login` flow: render the Yandex 360 login in a webview, let the user authenticate, capture the resulting token via a local webhook/callback. |
| Webhook / callback | Local HTTP listener that receives the intercepted token after web login. |
| Agent skill | A drop-in skill wrapping the CLI so any AI agent can drive Yandex 360 through it. |
| Homebrew tap | The owner's custom `brew` tap that distributes `yx360-cli` (`brew install`). |
| Web surface | The Yandex 360 web app's endpoint set — the first/easier reverse-engineering target. |
| Mobile surface | The Yandex 360 mobile app's endpoint set — escalation target if the web surface lacks something. |
